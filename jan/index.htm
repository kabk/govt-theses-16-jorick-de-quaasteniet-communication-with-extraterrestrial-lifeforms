		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p> 
			In 1972 and 1973, <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip2">NASA<span><img src="images/nasa.png" />National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span></a>  
			launched two probes into outerspace called the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecrafts. Both of them had a gold-anodized aluminium plaque on board engraved with 
			illustrations of the physique of a human male and female. With additional symbols explaining its origin. These plates where were added to the spacecraft to communicate 
			with any extraterrestrial life form that might come upon them. Some years later, in 1977, NASA launched the Voyager spacecrafts. On board they included golden phonograph 
			records containing a selection of sounds and images selected to portray our way of living on earth. The launching of these spacecraft could be compared to throwing a 
			bottle with a message in the ocean, hoping that someone, or something will encounter it and be able to read the message. But in the case of such an encounter, would these 
			images and sounds be sufficiently communicative? How will it communicate with a life form that we know nothing of? What kind of influence does the choice of communication 
			have on the first encounter? Can we apply the knowledge we have from our own ways of communicating?
		</p>
		<p>
 			In the last century, technological advancements have made it possible for humankind to explore the universe around us. With the vast amount of galaxies already 
			discovered — and that amount is only rising — it could be said that it is only a matter of time untill we find another life form in outerspace. And who is to say 
			whether these life forms are capable of communication? It might be bacteria, dwelling in the depths of Titan’s methane lakes (1). But we might also stumble onto a 
			planet whith a rich flora and fauna, just like our planet Earth, providing accomodation for a species capable of basic  advanced communication skills. Apart from 
			the possibility that they exist, who is to say we will make first contact with them? They might innitiate contact. Who knows what the results of such an encounter 
			would be? Will we be able to understand each other? Who decides on the content of our message? How important is our cultural context in such a message? It raises 
			many questions, which I have tried to summarize in to one research question:<br/>
			In the hypothetical case of contact with an extraterrestrial life-form, what will the design of such a way of communication look like?
