    <h4>NASA's wet dream</h4>
<p>On the morning of the 28th of September, 2015, I was sitting at my desk working on this very thesis, when I reveived a message from a friend, telling me that <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip2">NASA<span><img src="images/nasa.png" />National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span></a>  was to announce something big that evening. My mind immediately jumped to the conclusion that they must have found evidence of extraterrestrial lifeforms. Which would have been great, seeing as it would make writing this thesis even more relevant. Unfortunately, they didn't. What they had found was proof of liquid water on the surface of Mars, which is less exciting as the discovery of otherworldy beings, but for NASA and humankinds future space endeavors, still a big deal.</p>

<p>A couple of decades earlier, in 1972 and 1973, NASA launched two probes into outerspace called the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecrafts. Both of them had a <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip2">golden plaque<span><img src="images/plaque.jpg" /></span></a> on board engraved with illustrations of the physique of a human male and female. With additional symbols explaining the origin of the spacecraft. These plaques where intented for the event if any form of extraterrestrial life where to intercept the crafts; to communicate with 'them'. Some years later, in 1977, NASA launched the Voyager spacecrafts. On board they included golden phonograph records containing a selection of <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip2">sounds<span><iframe width="300px" height="200" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/129030648&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></span></a> and <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="tooltip2">images<span><img src="images/animation.gif" />The 126 images included on the record</span></a> selected to portray our way of living on earth. The launching of these spacecraft could be compared to throwing a bottle with a message in the ocean, except that the ocean in this case is the almost infinite vastness of space and the bottle is a highly sophisticated piece of technology.</p>

<p>It all might sound like science-fiction; entertainment for star-gazers and conspiracy-theorists. But isn't it more than just that?  In history, science-fiction has been used as a device to predict the future and to hypothesize about the direction we as human-kind are going into. Using our imagination it has taken us beyond the limits that science has given us in the past. It is used to reflect upon our society, to give social, economical and ecological commentary, and to explore the immensity of the universe, and the part that we play in it. Science-fiction and modern science have made us aware of how absurdly small our planet is amongst the billions of stars, and how uniquely populated it is. Besides, many subjects that science-fiction has dealt with that seemed ridiculous at the time, were an inspiration for modern science and have become part of our daily life. Think about men walking on the moon, probes sent into interstellar space (1) (the same one that is carrying a message for ET-lifeforms) and commercial space-travel (2).</p>

<p>There is, however, still one subject that has eluded the transition from science-fiction to science and is still solely a product of fiction. And that is the subject of extraterrestrial life. The age old question that deals with whether we are alone or not. With the limitation of science in earlier centuries there wasn't much contemplation towards the idea of extraterrestrial life, as our knowledge of the universe was limited, and we were still focused on figuring out things on our own planet. In the last century though, science has given us better and more powerful tools to observe and explore the universe we live in, and the possibilty of the existence of extraterrestrial life has become a more likely scenario. It is the opinion (and maybe dream) of many scientists (and myself) that it will only be a matter of time until we find proof of extraterrestrial life- forms.
"I think we'll find E.T. within two dozen years using these sorts of experiments," Seth Shostak, Senior Astronomer and Director, SETI, during a talk at the 2014 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts
And when we finally do make contact, it will be an entirely new question on how we are going to communicate with one another. As of yet, there has been no hard evidence on the existence of extraterrestrial life, but it might not be such a bad idea to think ahead of the many possibilities that this kind of discovery will bring with itself. Therefore my research question is as follows: In the hypothetical case of contact with an extraterrestrial life-form, what will the design of such a way of communication look like?</p>

<p>To make on thing clear though, this thesis is not about the possibility of making contact with an extraterrestrial life-form, it is about the hypothetical case in which we actually do make contact and in what way we can make this contact successful. For that matter, I will be taking a closer look into the actual attempts that have already been made to make contact, the attempts of fiction to describe such contact and the way communication studies here on earth can help in designing a valid(?) form of communication. You see, the thing that all these ways of communicating have in common, is that they are all designed to communicate. They have been designed for a specific purpose. They are  the products of thought-processes from scientists and artists to try to figure out in what way we will communicate with an extraterrestrial life-form.</p>

    <p>In the 1996 movie Mars Attacks! a seemingly friendly representative party(?) from Mars lands its flying saucer in the Nevada(?) desert to meet with humankind. They are warm-heartedly welcomed by an American army general. Although, there is a substantial army present, just in case. News-reporters from all over America are at the scene to report this important occasion, and the eyes of every American are pointed at their television to witness this momentous occasion. When the Martian and human are standing face to face, the human general sticks out his hand in order to give the Martian ambassador a handshake, but this gesture is not recognized by the extraterrestrial. The general then remembers one of the Martians making a circle with its finger in a scene before and continues by doing the same; he forms a circle in the air with his finger, which the Martian repeats. The first understanding between humans and Extraterrestrial has been made. A conversation continues which is translated by a translating machine of which the workings remain unexplained. The Martians announce they come in peace. America breathes a sigh of relief and a long-haired hippie in the crowd releases a white dove to give the moment a symbolic meaning. The dove flaps happily over the ecstatic crowd and is then incinerated by an energybeam originated from the gun of the Martian ambassador. Apparently, the Martians consider a white dove to be an insult of some sorts, after which they declare war on humankind and start the process of extermination.</p>

<p>This scene, however silly and exaggerated the rest of the movie might be, has some interesting points. First of all, the handshake initiated by the general. A handshake is a gesture of which the origins can be traced back all the way to the ancient Greeks(img). It is usually meant as a way of introducing oneself into a social situation. It is believed that the origins of the handshake lie in the ancient etiquette of soldiers.  To show to one another that one has empty hands and carries no weapons. But, handshakes are known to spread germs, which can be some of the most powerful weapons, looking at what happened to Native Americans when Europeans arrived (source). For the possibility of exotic diseases alone, it should be considered to initially avoid any sort of physical contact. 
In other words, to have contact from a safe distance, until we are sure we won’t kill eachother with our germs. The relevance of the handshake is based on the shared knowledge of both the receiving and innitiating party that when one sticks his hand out towards the other, that hand is supposed to be grabbed by the opposite hand of the other after which both hands are shaken up and down by an agreeable amount of time. Sometimes this up and down movement is only done once(img), sometimes the movement continues while a conversation is struck up(img), and sometimes one of the participants adds a little flair to it by putting his other hand in the mix(img). But even as simple a gesture as a handshake can end up in an awkward situation when different cultures  with different customs meet(img). Either way, this seemingly small gesture, that has many variations already, has a lot of cultural and social relevance, to humans that is. When meeting with a lifeform from another planet, chances are small they will understand the significance and meaning of it. Also, they might not have hands. Or they might see the hand as a weapon and the pointing of it as an act of agression. There are many thinkable ways in which the physical act of shaking hands can be interpreted negatively. This tells us that it is important to keep in mind that an extraterrestrial lifeform might have a completely different physical appearance than ours, an anthropocentric approach to any form of communication and/or design is therefore discouraged. The problem that gives us is how to translate a simple message like a handshake to something non-anthropocentric. </p>

<p>The Martian does have hands though, but he doesn't seem to understand the gesture of the handshake, the general therefore continues by pointing his finger in the air and moving it in the motion of a full circle, which the Martian repeats (img). This is actually a more realistic portrayal of how humans could initiate contact with extraterrestrials, seeing as many scientists agree that the language of physics and mathemetics is a universal one, as these are mostly constant throughout the universe. (SOURCE?) A circle, for example, is abundant in the universe. In fact, one of the first proposals for actually communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms was done in 1820 by German mathemetician Carl Friedrich Gauss (time) who, in an attempt to create what might be considered one of the largest pieces of land art ever, suggested to cut down an enormous portion of a Siberian forest in the shape of a triangle with three rectangles attached to it and replant the area with wheat. (The choice for wheat was because of the contrast in color it would create with the trees). These shapes seen from space would suggest an understanding of the Pythagorean theorem, a mathemetical equation that only an intelligent lifeform could be capable of understanding. According to Carl, they would be large enough to be seen by life-forms on the Moon or Mars. A similar proposal came from Joseph Johann Littrow (TIME), although his was a bit more extreme. He suggested to dig enormous 30 kilometer wide canals in various geometric shapes in the Saharan desert, fill them with kerosene, and light them on fire. This to create giant signal fires which, ofcourse, would show any extraterrestrial paying attention a sign of human intelligence on Earth. 
These ideas were never put into practise, and for environmental reasons, probably never will be, but they are a good indication of how even in the early days of space exploration the language of mathemetics was already considered a viable candidate as a form of communication with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Especially if the intention of our communication is to make ourselves known in the universe. If can be used as a means of telling any ET that is listening or watching that there is (fairly) intelligent life here on Earth. Next to mathematics, It is also important to note that the language of sciences such as physics and chemistry is, as far as we know, consistent throughout the universe, and can in such way also be used to communicate. But after making ourselves known by means of mathemetics or a different scientific language, how we will be able to express ourselves? Science might not be enough to communicate more complex concepts and ideas, like emotions and culture.</p>

<p>(sidenote?) The thing is, nowadays we won’t need to make these kind of landmarks to show our existence, since we already have(img Zuid-Holland). Any Martian with a telescope strong enough will be able to see our presence here on Earth. Our cities are growing bigger and bigger and emit enormous amounts of artificial light. In this way we are already communicating our presence, just not with any intentional message.</p>

<p>The next part in this fictional encounter between humans and Martians is one of miscommunication. The white dove is one of the many kinds of birds that inhabit our planet, but to us humans, it has a special meaning. It is a symbol of peace that has been taught to us by cultural knowledge in the community we live in. When using a model like that of Saussure (source) to analyse the symbolic meaning of a white dove, it can be said that the white dove in its form is the signifier and the concept of peace is the signified. To us, a white dove symbolizes peace, love and good intentions. During the evolution of human cultures, the world has become saturated with these kind of symbols, we have given meaning to virtually every object, gesture and living thing thinkable. (quote; we think only in signs) A finger of the hand can either offend(img), support(img Nina) or direct(img), and depending on the culture, these meaning assigned to these fingers can differ.</p>

“WE THINK ONLY IN SIGNS” Charles Sanders Peirce

<p>The Martians, however, haven't had the same cultural evolution as we did and to them the dove could signify a completely different concept. In this case it's apparently the opposite of peace. Or they might have recognized the dove as a weapon of some sorts, seeing as it is highly improbable there are white doves on Mars. Thinking that extraterrestrials will understand any of our own habitual ways of communication might prove to be a big misconception. The arrow on the pioneer plaque for example (img), is a typical anthropocentric symbol, which is derived from our historic usage of arrows for hunting, and which to us has become a way of pointing out a certain direction. To us, this seems clear, but to a lifeform that has another way of conveying direction it might be confusing.
A way to solve this would be to explain how an arrow works. In a static way, this could be done by looking at the universe and its many occurences in which direction plays an important part. The orbits of planets, or the path of a meteoroid. These can be used to explain the directional message of an arrow. (example)</p>
